hw09: Advanced shaders

Bruno Henrique Gouveia

I used tesselation and geometry shaders with techniques from previous homework (such as normal map) to make that each face of a cube be an approximation of a terrain.
In order to do that, I just used an height map. In the tesselation shader, when I create a new vertex, I add the height of the terraint to this point (we use the normal to see in which direction we should add the height).

There are a lot of technical details, but they are basically variations from previous homework.

You can change de inner and outer levels to get a better or worst approximation of the terrain.

I spent 6 hours, because tesselation and geometry shader were kind of confusing, so I had to figure out how they work exactly.
